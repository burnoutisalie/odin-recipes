# Project: Recipes
##### *Foundations Course*
**Live Demo:** [Visit the website](https://github.com/burnoutisalie/odin-recipes)

Basic recipe website to test the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far. It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipe pages.

You can find my favorite recipes for such meals, as Uzbek pilaf, burger, and egg fried rice.

I am super excited to apply my knowledge on a real project, and showcase it to the world!
## Tech Skills Applied
1. **HTML**
    - HTML boilerplate
    - Paragraphs and Headings
    - Working with Text: bold, italic, comments
    - Lists
    - Links
    - Images
    - File Structure
    - Semantic HTML
2. **Git**
    - Basic commands
    - Commit Messages best practices
3. **GitHub**
    - Working with a remote repo
    - Publish web projects directly from GitHub
## Lessons Learned
- Re-reading my code helped to improve the style and structure. Did a couple of commits refactoring the code.
- Spent *a lot of time* on choosing which recipes to go with, what is the right wording to use in the *Ingredients* and *Steps* sections to not confuse the end user, if they decide to give recipes a go. In other words, struggled with content more than code for this time.
