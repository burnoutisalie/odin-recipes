    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy and customizable meal is my go to whenever I feel lazy, and have extra rice left from yesterday. Because it doesn't take too much time, and lets you hit those nutrient goals.</p>
    <p>The version in this recipe is somewhat basic, but feel free to customize it by adding any protein (chicken, beef, etc.), or vegetables (corn, peas, green/red chili pepper, carrots, etc.) according to taste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 Tbsp. neutral oil, divided</li>
      <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>4 scallions, thinly sliced crosswise, divided</li>
      <li>3-4 cups of cooked cold rice (preferrably day-old)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp. soy sauce, or to taste</li>
      <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat a wok or a non-stick frying pan over high heat. Lower the heat to low or medium. Add 1 tablespoon of oil. Swirl to coat the surface of wok with oil.</li>
      <li>Add eggs. Cook and stir them until golden brown on the bottom for about 10-30 seconds. Flip eggs and cook them until golden brown on the other side.</li>
      <li>Return to high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add white parts of scallions (and the rest of your veggies) on top of eggs, and stir-fry them until soft.</li>
      <li>Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Add rice, and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the rice is warm, breaking down eggs and clumps of rice with a spatula.</li>
      <li>Lower the heat to low. Add soy sauce, salt and ground black pepper to taste. Increase the heat to high and stir-fry for about 2-3 minutes until rice and eggs are evenly coated in the soy sauce, and rice doesn't have any large clumps.</li>
      <li>Taste and add more seasoning if needed. Turn the heat off and add green parts of scallions. Stir for another minute to mix everything together.</li>
      <li>Transfer egg fried rice to a plate or a bowl and serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
