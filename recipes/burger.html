        <h1>Burger</h1>
        <p>Burger is one of my favorite meals that I love experimenting with. It is very versatile, and anyone can make a burger to their own taste: custom meat, cheese, bun, topping choices to name a few.</p>
        <p>The following burger recipe though is my current favorite. It is perfectly balanced, with my top choice of ingredients, portion sizes, and texture. Give it a go!</p>

          Heat a large griddle or nonstick cast iron skillet over medium heat. Spread about 1.5 teaspoons of softened butter per bun on the inside of the top and bottom of white sesame seed buns to fully coat the surface area. Toast the buns butter-side down, moving them around the surface of the griddle until evenly toasted and golden brown, 2-3 minutes. Once the insides are toasted, overturn each bun to lightly toast the tops, another 30 seconds. Set to the side and repeat with all your buns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wipe out the griddle or nonstick cast iron skillet with a paper towel and increase the heat to medium high. Roll your ground beef into 56g balls. Once your cooking surface is hot, place your meat onto your griddle at least 10cm apart from each other. Using a large heavy spatula or burger press, smash both of your meat balls into the griddle until about 3mm thick. Season with salt and pepper to taste and cook for about 1 minute 30 seconds, or until you have a deep golden brown crust underneath. Using a thin, sturdy spatula, or an edge scraper, scrape aggressively underneath and flip both burgers, being careful to keep them in the same place so they continue cooking in their own fat. Add one slice of American cheese to each burger patty. Once melted, place one burger patty on top of the other. Those 2 patties make patties for one burger. Repeat with the rest of your beef for a total of 4 burgers worth of patties.
        </li>

          To assemble, spread mustard on the inside on both your top and bottom buns. On each bottom bun, spread evenly 3-4 dill pickle slices and 1 tablespoon diced onions. Add your double patties to each burger. Add your top bun, and serve immediately. Enjoy!
