    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Burger is one of my favorite meals that I love experimenting with. It is very versatile, and anyone can make a burger to their own taste: custom meat, cheese, bun, topping choices to name a few.</p>
    <p>The following burger recipe though is my current favorite. It is perfectly balanced, with my top choice of ingredients, portion sizes, and texture. Give it a go!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 White sesame seed hamburger bun</li>
      <li>Unsalted butter, softened, for toasting</li>
      <li>450g 75% ground beef</li>
      <li>&frac12; sweet onion, medium dice</li>
