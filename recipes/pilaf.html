    <h1>Pilaf</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In my homecountry, we call this meal Osh, or Palov. Pilaf is so central to the culture of Uzbekistan, that in our language the word chef literally translates to <em>OSH</em>paz, which means osh master chef. And I have got to give the linguists respect, because it is a recipe that can be easy, or can be hard, depending on how much detail-oriented and perfectionist you are. Which means, if you can prepare pilaf near perfect, you can deal with most other meals.</p>
    <p>Pilaf is an old recipe that has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaf#Local_varieties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many varieties</a> around the world. Because of that, here is the thing, which somewhat contradicts with the previous paragraph's last sentence: there is no ideal recipe of pilaf. In Uzbekistan, every region has their own variety of pilaf. Even two neighbors, using the same ingredients might have completely different, yet delicious results!</p>
    <p>Another cultural importance of this meal lies in a fact, that it is usually prepared in a large qazan (cast-iron cooking pot) over an open fire to a large gathering of guests, and is an inseparable part of any Uzbek wedding. In past, such conquerors as Tamerlane and Alexander the Great used pilaf to feed the vast number of their soldiers.</p>
    <p>In this recipe, we will be going for a simple and delicious, my favorite Uzbek version of pilaf that you can cook at home!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>1 kg lamb (boneless), cut into bite-sized cubes</li>
      <li>1 kg short- or medium-grain rice</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 small or &frac12; medium onion</li>
      <li>300-350 ml vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 kg old carrots, batonnet cut (1:1 ratio with rice)</li>
      <li>60 degrees warm water (for soaking rice)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon whole cumin seeds</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gently rinse the rice under warm water in a pot to remove the surface starch, pouring out the cloudy water until the water becomes clear. Be very gentle with rice at all stages! Soak the rice in 60 degrees warm water and set aside. The rice should be soaked for at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour vegetable oil to a large, thick-walled cast iron cooking pot (ideally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazan_(cookware)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kazan</a>) and heat it well until it begins to smoke lightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take 1 whole small or &frac12; medium onion, remove the skin, and fry it in kazan on all sides until lightly brown. Then remove the onion and discard it. This onion absorbs the weird flavor of the oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry thinly sliced onions on high heat until golden brown. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Add bite-sized cubes of lamb to caramelized, golden brown onions. Let it cook on one side until golden brown, then periodically turn until golden brown on all sides. Side note: for 1 kg rice, you can use smaller amount of meat, to your taste and budget.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put in the carrots and fry them for 10-15 minutes, carefully stirring, until they are fork-tender. To check if the carrots are tender, remove a slice and hold it by one end. If it bends easily, and the other end drops, it's ready. When the carrots are almost tender, add the cumin seeds. Stir everything together. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the heat to medium and pour in the hot water until it covers everything by 1-1&frac12;cm. When the water boils, turn the heat to low and let it simmer for at least 40 minutes to 1 hour. This broth is called "zirvak".
      </li>
      <li>
        When zirvak is ready, turn to high heat. Salt the broth and taste - it should be very salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully drain the soaked rice and gently add it into the kazan in an even layer on top of the other ingredients. If the zirvak's broth does not fully cover the rice, add boiling water until it slightly covers the rice. This is the most tricky part: we want our rice to become light, fluffy and most importantly separate. We do not want our rice to become soggy and mushy! That is why you have to be careful to not add water more than needed. Now, two events must coincide: when rice absorbs all water and when rice is almost done, but still a bit crunchy. Cook the rice on a very high heat, so that the oil floats to the top. And either do not touch anything in the process (safe route), or without stirring, carefully redistribute the rice to ensure even cooking, gently moving it from the edges towards center and from top to bottom, and vice versa, trying not to touch a layer of carrots and meat (requires a bit of practice).
      </li>
      <li>
        If you can chew through rice, do not add more water. If the rice is too hard to chew through, add a tiny bit more water. As the water drops below the rice, make 3-5 holes in the rice to help water escape more quickly. Check the holes or sides of kazan for any remaining water. Don't confuse water with oil - there will still be oil at the bottom of the kazan.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the water is gone, turn the heat to a minimum. Make a small "hill" of rice, so that it does not come in contact with the cold walls of the kazan, because it is in this place that it will become sticky. Season top of the rice with a pinch of cumin seeds. Now, cover the kazan tightly so that no steam at all escapes. To do that, cover the rice with appropriately sized plate first (there could be a small gap between the plate and the kazan edges, if you can't find perfect fit). Cover the kazan with the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Steam the rice for 20-45 minutes, depending on how done your rice was in the previous step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat. Being careful of the hot steam, remove the lid and the plate. Carefully and thoroughly mix the rice with the carrots and the meat, shaking the rice to help its grains separate from each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer it to a plate and serve hot. <em>Osh bulsin!</em> (which means <em>Bon app&eacute;tit!</em> in Uzbek).
      </li>
      <li>
        Extra: serve with a simple "achik chuchuk" salad, which is ideal for pilaf. Mix sliced tomatoes and onions with salt and you're good to go. I recommend drinking hot green tea with pilaf, perfect choice for greasy dishes.
