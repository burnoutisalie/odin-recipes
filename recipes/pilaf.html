    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In my homecountry, we call this meal Osh, or Palov. Pilaf is so central to the culture of Uzbekistan, that in our language the word chef literally translates to <em>OSH</em>paz, which means osh master chef. And I have got to give the linguists respect, because it is a recipe that can be easy, or can be hard, depending on how much detail-oriented and perfectionist you are. Which means, if you can prepare pilaf near perfect, you can deal with most other meals.</p>
    <p>Pilaf is an old recipe that has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaf#Local_varieties">many varieties</a> around the world. Because of that, here is the thing, which somewhat contradicts with the previous paragraph's last sentence: there is no ideal recipe of pilaf. In Uzbekistan, every region has their own variety of pilaf. Even two neighbors, using the same ingredients might have completely different, yet delicious results!</p>
    <p>Another cultural importance of this meal lies in a fact, that it is usually prepared in a large qazan (cast-iron cooking pot) over an open fire to a large gathering of guests, and is an inseparable part of any Uzbek wedding. In past, such conquerors as Tamerlane and Alexander the Great used pilaf to feed the vast number of their soldiers.</p>
    <p>In this recipe, we will be going for a simple and delicious, my favorite Uzbek version of pilaf that you can cook at home!</p>
