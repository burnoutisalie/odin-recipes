    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In my homecountry, we call this meal Osh, or Palov. Pilaf is so central to the culture of Uzbekistan, that in our language the word chef literally translates to <em>OSH</em>paz, which means osh master chef. And I have got to give the linguists respect, because it is a recipe that can be easy, or can be hard, depending on how much detail-oriented and perfectionist you are. Which means, if you can prepare pilaf near perfect, you can deal with most other meals.</p>
    <p>Pilaf is an old recipe that has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaf#Local_varieties">many varieties</a> around the world.</p>
    <p>Another cultural importance of this meal lies in a fact, that it is usually prepared in a qazan (large cast-iron cooking pot) over an open fire to a large gathering of guests, and is an inseparable part of any Uzbek wedding. </p>
    <p>In this recipe, we will be going for a simple and delicious, my favorite Uzbek version of pilaf that you can cook at home!</p>
